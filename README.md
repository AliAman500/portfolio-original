# Portfolio (Discontinued)

## Project Overview
This was a fully completed project aimed at creating a portfolio website with a full backend and frontend. The backend was built using Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf was used for server-side rendering. The frontend was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Docker was utilized to containerize the application. Although the project was fully functional, it was never deployed due to hosting costs. A simpler, frontend-only version of the project was created instead.

## Features
- **Backend (Spring Boot)**: 
  - Message sending functionality (e.g., contact form).
  - REST endpoints for handling form submissions.

- **Frontend (Thymeleaf + HTML/CSS/JS)**: 
  - Dynamic HTML rendering using Thymeleaf.
  - Basic styles with CSS and interactions using JavaScript.

- **Docker**: 
  - Containerized the Spring Boot application for easy deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Discontinued Reason
The project was fully completed but not deployed due to the cost of hosting the backend. A simpler, static version of the portfolio website was created and deployed using GitHub Pages.
